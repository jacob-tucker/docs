title: "RoyaltyPolicyLAP"
---

The RoyaltyPolicyLAP (Liquid Absolute Percentage) contract defines the logic for splitting royalties for a given IP asset using a liquid absolute percentage mechanism. It manages the royalty relationships between IP assets and their ancestors, allowing for the transfer of revenue tokens to the appropriate royalty vaults.

## State Variables

### RoyaltyPolicyLAPStorage

```solidity
struct RoyaltyPolicyLAPStorage {
    mapping(address ipId => uint32) royaltyStackLAP;
    mapping(address ipId => mapping(address ancestorIpId => uint32)) ancestorPercentLAP;
    mapping(address ipId => mapping(address ancestorIpId => mapping(address token => uint256))) transferredTokenLAP;
}
```

Storage structure for the RoyaltyPolicyLAP containing:
- `royaltyStackLAP`: Sum of the royalty percentages to be paid to all ancestors for LAP royalty policy
- `ancestorPercentLAP`: The royalty percentage between an IP asset and a given ancestor for LAP royalty policy
- `transferredTokenLAP`: Total lifetime revenue tokens transferred to a vault from a descendant IP via LAP

## Events

### RevenueTransferredToVault

```solidity
event RevenueTransferredToVault(address ipId, address ancestorIpId, address token, uint256 amount)
```

Emitted when revenue tokens are transferred to a vault.

**Parameters:**

- `ipId`: The ipId of the IP asset
- `ancestorIpId`: The ancestor ipId of the IP asset
- `token`: The token address transferred

## Security Considerations

The RoyaltyPolicyLAP contract implements several security measures:

1. **Access Control**: Functions like `onLicenseMinting` and `onLinkToParents` can only be called by the Royalty Module through the `onlyRoyaltyModule` modifier.

2. **Reentrancy Protection**: The `nonReentrant` modifier is used on functions that handle token transfers to prevent reentrancy attacks.

3. **Pausability**: The contract can be paused in emergency situations using the `whenNotPaused` modifier.

4. **Safe Token Transfers**: The contract uses OpenZeppelin's SafeERC20 library to ensure safe token transfers.

5. **Upgradability**: The contract is upgradable using the UUPS pattern, with upgrade authorization restricted to the protocol admin.

6. **Input Validation**: The contract validates inputs and checks for edge cases, such as preventing transfers between the same IP.
