title: "RoyaltyPolicyLRP"
---

The RoyaltyPolicyLRP (Liquid Relative Percentage) contract defines the logic for splitting royalties for a given IP asset using a liquid relative percentage mechanism. It manages the royalty relationships between IP assets and their ancestors, allowing for the transfer of revenue tokens to the appropriate royalty vaults.

## State Variables

### RoyaltyPolicyLRPStorage

```solidity
struct RoyaltyPolicyLRPStorage {
    mapping(address ipId => uint32) royaltyStackLRP;
    mapping(address ipId => mapping(address ancestorIpId => uint32)) ancestorPercentLRP;
    mapping(address ipId => mapping(address ancestorIpId => mapping(address token => uint256))) transferredTokenLRP;
}
```

Storage structure for the RoyaltyPolicyLRP containing:
- `royaltyStackLRP`: Sum of the royalty percentages to be paid to all ancestors for LRP royalty policy
- `ancestorPercentLRP`: The royalty percentage between an IP asset and a given ancestor for LRP royalty policy
- `transferredTokenLRP`: Total lifetime revenue tokens transferred to a vault from a descendant IP via LRP

## Security Considerations

The RoyaltyPolicyLRP contract implements several security measures:

1. **Access Control**: Functions like `onLicenseMinting` and `onLinkToParents` can only be called by the Royalty Module through the `onlyRoyaltyModule` modifier.

2. **Reentrancy Protection**: The `nonReentrant` modifier is used on functions that handle token transfers to prevent reentrancy attacks.

3. **Pausability**: The contract can be paused in emergency situations using the `whenNotPaused` modifier.

4. **Safe Token Transfers**: The contract uses OpenZeppelin's SafeERC20 library to ensure safe token transfers.

5. **Upgradability**: The contract is upgradable using the UUPS pattern, with upgrade authorization restricted to the protocol admin.

6. **Input Validation**: The contract validates inputs and checks for edge cases, such as preventing transfers between the same IP.

## Royalty Dilution Considerations

The LRP (Liquid Relative Percentage) royalty policy allows each remixed IP to receive a percentage of the revenue generated by its direct derivatives. However, it's important to understand the potential dilution of royalties as more derivatives are created between two IPs.

This dilution can reduce the earnings of the original IP creator as more layers of derivatives are added. For example:

1. Creator 1 - Registers IP1, mints an LRP license of 10%, and sells the license to Creator 2.
2. Creator 2 - Registers IP2 as a derivative of IP1 and mints an LRP license of 20% for himself/herself.
3. Creator 2 - Registers IP3 as a derivative of IP2 and promotes IP3 commercially in the market.

The earnings for Creator 1 are diluted because they will only receive 10% of the 20% royalties from IP3, resulting in an effective royalty of 2%. If Creator 2 had chosen to promote IP2 instead, Creator 1 would have earned 10% directly, avoiding this dilution.

In contrast, the LAP (Liquid Absolute Percentage) royalty policy enforces a fixed percentage on every descendant IP, protecting the original creator from dilution.
