Below you will find two sections:

1. **Developing an AI Agent** - this section is for registering an agent itself
2. **Implementing ATCP/IP** - this section is for implementing the **_2. An ATCP/IP Transaction_** section of the <a href="https://story.foundation/whitepaper.pdf" target="_blank">Whitepaper</a>.

## Developing an Agent

Below are details on how to:

- Register an AI Agent as IP
- Add License Terms to your AI Agent

### Registering an Agent

In order to register an AI Agent (or any IP) on Story, follow the [How to Register IP on Story](https://docs.story.foundation/docs/how-to-register-ip-on-story) tutorial. The only difference for AI Agents is how you structure your IP Metadata, which should follow the [üìù IPA Metadata Standard](doc:ipa-metadata-standard).

Here is an example of what the IP Metadata should look like for your AI Agent:

```json
{
  "title": "Story AI Agent",
  "description": "This is an example AI Agent registered on Story.",
  "createdAt": "1740005219",
  "creators": [
    {
      "name": "Jacob Tucker",
      "address": "0xA2f9Cf1E40D7b03aB81e34BC50f0A8c67B4e9112",
      "contributionPercent": 100
    }
  ],
  "image": "https://ipfs.io/ipfs/bafybeigi3k77t5h5aefwpzvx3uiomuavdvqwn5rb5uhd7i7xcq466wvute",
  "imageHash": "0x64ccc40de203f218d16bb90878ecca4338e566ab329bf7be906493ce77b1551a",

  "aiMetadata": {

    "characterFileHash": "0x5e253875b6d7e7a4e407da899473b168229def8cc6a783957c35996928494d2d"
  },
  "ipType": "AI Agent",
  "tags": ["AI Agent", "Twitter bot", "Smart Agent"]
}
```

### Adding Terms to your AI Agent

Upon registering your AI Agent, you can add license terms to it. However you can add more license terms to your AI Agent afterwards as well. Follow the below tutorials to learn how to do this:
