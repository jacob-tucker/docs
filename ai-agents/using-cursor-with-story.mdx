[Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/) is an AI code editor that makes it easy to write code while building Story apps. Let's walk through how to setup Cursor for the best possible results with Story.

## Add Story Docs

Adding Story docs lets you interact with our docs directly and get the most accurate answers to your questions.

1. Go to Cursor Settings > Features > Docs and click "+ Add new doc"

</Frame>

2. Paste the URL `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/storyprotocol/documentation/refs/heads/v1.3/combined.md`

<Note>
  This is our entire documentation combined into a single `.md` file, **which is
  automatically updated every single time our docs have changes.**
</Note>

3. Change the name to Story, and leave everything else the same

## Using the Docs

You can then reference the Story docs in your prompt with the `@Story` symbol.
