## 1. Create a Song

Before we register music on Story, you'll obviously need some music! If you already have music, make sure you have a link to the music file directly. For example, `https://cdn1.suno.ai/dcd3076f-3aa5-400b-ba5d-87d30f27c311.mp3`. If you don't already have this, you can upload your music file to IPFS:

If you want to create a test song, go to [Suno](https://suno.com), which is an awesome platform for AI-generated music. We can get a test song by:

1. Inputting a prompt to create a song
2. Click on the final result, which should take you to a URL like `https://suno.com/song/dcd3076f-3aa5-400b-ba5d-87d30f27c311`
3. Copy the the `SONG_ID` in the URL (`dcd3076f-3aa5-400b-ba5d-87d30f27c311`)
4. Copy the following URL: `https://cdn1.suno.ai/${SONG_ID}.mp3`, making sure to replace `SONG_ID` with your own.

This is the URL we'll use in step 2.

## 2. Complete the "How to Register IP" Tutorial

Most of what we need to do is already covered in [Register an IP Asset](/developers/typescript-sdk/register-an-ip-asset). Complete that tutorial first, and then come back here.

## 3. Change Metadata

The only difference is how you set your metadata. Here is an example:

* `image.*` is used to display a cover image when your song is registered
* `media.*` is used for the audio file. Also note that the fields passed into `media.*` are checked for infringement by the [Story Attestation Service](/developers/story-attestation-service).

```typescript main.ts
const ipMetadata = {
  title: 'Midnight Marriage',
  description: 'This is a house-style song generated on suno.',
  createdAt: '1740005219',
  creators: [
    {
      name: 'Jacob Tucker',
      address: '0xA2f9Cf1E40D7b03aB81e34BC50f0A8c67B4e9112',
      contributionPercent: 100,
    },
  ],
  image: 'https://cdn2.suno.ai/image_large_8bcba6bc-3f60-4921-b148-f32a59086a4c.jpeg',
  imageHash: '0xc404730cdcdf7e5e54e8f16bc6687f97c6578a296f4a21b452d8a6ecabd61bcc',
  mediaUrl: 'https://cdn1.suno.ai/dcd3076f-3aa5-400b-ba5d-87d30f27c311.mp3',
  mediaHash: '0xb52a44f53b2485ba772bd4857a443e1fb942cf5dda73c870e2d2238ecd607aee',
  mediaType: 'audio/mpeg',
}
```

After you've done that, you can set your NFT metadata like so:

* `image` for the cover image
* `animation_url` is used for the audio file
* `attributes` for any extra attributes you want to include

```typescript main.ts
const nftMetadata = {
  name: 'Midnight Marriage',
  description: 'This is a house-style song generated on suno. This NFT represents ownership of the IP Asset.',
  image: 'https://cdn2.suno.ai/image_large_8bcba6bc-3f60-4921-b148-f32a59086a4c.jpeg',
  animation_url: 'https://cdn1.suno.ai/dcd3076f-3aa5-400b-ba5d-87d30f27c311.mp3',
  attributes: [
    {
      key: 'Suno Artist',
      value: 'amazedneurofunk956',
    },
    {
      key: 'Artist ID',
      value: '4123743b-8ba6-4028-a965-75b79a3ad424',
    },
    {
      key: 'Source',
      value: 'Suno.com',
    },
  ],
}
```

## 4. Done!

When you run the script, you will register an IP Asset and it will look something like [this](https://aeneid.explorer.story.foundation/ipa/0x70920EaC7F9748Ac5A71C82310f1ac1C7eD11f02) on our explorer.

You can see the explorer recognizes the metadata format, and you can play the song directly on the page!
