# Overview

Story Network is a purpose-built layer 1 blockchain achieving the best of EVM and Cosmos SDK. It is 100% EVM-compatible alongside deep execution layer optimizations to support graph data structures, purpose-built for handling complex data structures like IP quickly and cost-efficiently. It does this by:

- using precompiled primitives to traverse complex data structures like IP graphs within seconds at marginal costs
- a consensus layer based on the mature CometBFT stack to ensure fast finality and cheap transactions
- a modular architecture that decouples consensus from execution via Ethereumâ€™s Engine-API
